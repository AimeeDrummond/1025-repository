#Executive summary 
This lab sets out to describe and explain portions of a computers hardware such as the diskdrive and ram. It also sets out to explain how those parts work and how they interact between one another.

#Conclusion
Throughout the lab I had learned that information can actually physically be found on a disk. When you sit down to think about it, the concept makes a lot of sense.
However this thought had never truly dawned on me until I went and did the reasearch for this lab. It seems so simple yet the concept has stuck with me and I truly
believe that this idea will help me keep an open mind further into my carreer.
