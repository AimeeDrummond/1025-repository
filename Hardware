 Hard Drives and Memory 

A)In addition to the chapter reading, review the article: Hard Disk Performance and explain (under the Hard Drives heading): the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive.
   
   Latency is more easily explained as the amount of time it takes to actually find the data located on the disk while the transfer is how fast that data can be moved. The key difference between these two is that latency let's the data stay where it is, while transfer does exactly what it implies. It is moving the data from point a to point b.
   
B) -In addition to the chapter reading, review the article: Solid State Hard Drives and explain (also under the Hard Drives heading): how a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive.

  While they both serve the same purpose, the way they do it is completely different. While traditional hard disk drives store their data on a disk, rotate and find the data to export, solid state drives use something called solid state memory. Think of a flash drive for example, they don't exatly have room for a disk yet they store memory. This is an example of a solid state drive.
  
C)In addition to the chapter reading, watch the video: RAM Explained - Random Access Memory and explain (under the heading) 
 Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster? 
 Ram allows the computer to increase it's data transfer to other parts of the computer.

The difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths.
It is the differentiation of the amount of access that they have access to. If you want less, go with 32 bit, if you need more go to 64 bit.
