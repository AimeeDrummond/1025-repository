#executive summary:

within this lab, we will go over File and folder compression, Object oriented programming in python and lastly UML.

#file compresion
 The purpose and use of file compression is fairly simple, it is meant to compress a file to save space. Not that any information is lost, it is instead combined to 
 "save space".If for example you were to compress a jpg, you would loose data if you were to compress as Jpgs are a still image, whereas if you are to compress an SVG,
 you end up saving space without loosing any data as SVGs are vector images, the way they are made is more or less code rather than a still image. 
 
 #Object oriented programming
 Methods: Swim, Be Awesome
Properties: Self,Name,Sammy
The purpose of a constructor is to define objects an properties. A class is something that contains all the programming. Programming does not typically exist outside
a Class. An object is a specific instance of something, usually but not always a property. Instanating an object from a class is to be using an object outside the class
it was made in.
