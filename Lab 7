#executive summary:

within this lab, we will go over File and folder compression, Object oriented programming in python and lastly UML.

#file compresion
 The purpose and use of file compression is fairly simple, it is meant to compress a file to save space. Not that any information is lost, it is instead combined to 
 "save space".If for example you were to compress a jpg, you would loose data if you were to compress as Jpgs are a still image, whereas if you are to compress an SVG,
 you end up saving space without loosing any data as SVGs are vector images, the way they are made is more or less code rather than a still image. 
 
 #Object oriented programming
 Methods: Swim, Be Awesome
Properties: Self,Name,Sammy
The purpose of a constructor is to define objects an properties. A class is something that contains all the programming. Programming does not typically exist outside
a Class. An object is a specific instance of something, usually but not always a property. Instanating an object from a class is to be using an object outside the class
it was made in.

#UML
OMG in uml terms means Object Management Group, A standards company based around UML. Unified modeling lanugage is a kind of visual language based upon building code,
Architecture and a few other subjects.
Object--Sammy
Class--Shark
Abstraction--Spec kind of shark
encapsulation--Def of shark
Inheritance--Swim(Self)
I matched all of these as such to the best of my ability.

#Conclusion
As I am taking an Upper level IT class (1050), I can certainly say this lab would have been wonderful weeks ago when we first dove into all of this stuff.
This lab broke down exactly what I needed to know about classes and I wish I had access to this information sooner. As for UML, I'm uncertain how effective
sticking to rules will be for me later down the line as I personally do not enjoy limiting my own understanding to conform to others.
