### Executive summary
Within this lab, we will cover Databases, SQL and the implications of information systems to better understand how all of these elements fit in together.

#Data, Information and Knowledge
###Relational data
Data is quantitative, Numbers or text without any meaning if not given context. Information is that context. Knowledge is what you do with the data and its 
given informational context. If we are to use an example to explain these concepts in futher detail, we can site an example.

Say I were to build a database for a company and there are two tables: Customers and Orders
The Primary key for the Customer table would be a uniquely generated Id Associated with that full name, The orders table will use the order number for that order.
Both of these numbers will act as "ID's" The foreign key in the orders table would be called Order ID.
The datatypes of the fields are extremely important as two different data types cannot be directly compared.

#Big Data
The four "vs" of data are as follows:
Volume: The amount of data
Velocity: How fast the data moves
Variety: The different types of data and its resources
Veracity: How trust-worthy the data is

The types of tech that have driven the need for big data include but are not limited to:
Banks
Facebook (Social medias)
Cricket websites
Retail
Companies

#Structured query language
RDBMS is basis for all SQL coding. It has to do with data management and it's systems.
The Primary key between two of the provided tables is OrderID (Of orders) and the foreign key is also called OrderID. The relationship between these two is to better
define other details specifically geared towards what is in the Orders.

#SQLInjections
SQL injections are a large security threats as they are a fairly common hacking technique. It is "injecting" malicious code directlyh into the database, via
webpage input.
A great way to reduce this risk is to put paramaters around your data.

#Ethical and legal implications
The AMC Created Ethical codes for Data so that the technology does not circumvent or break the law. For example, you cannot just take someones identity without
legal recompense. 
The Code of ethics is far more geared towards what is illegal, AUP is what IS legal and what you can do with data.
(The AUP of twitter https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules#:~:text=Illegal%20or%20certain%20regulated%20goods,of%20regulated%20goods%20or%20services.)
It essentially forbidds twitter to be used for any illegal activities defined by another link provided in the article.


#intellectual property
The purpose and importance of the WIPO is the forum with which governmental establishments Creat laws about intellectual property laws.
Copyright is established through Individual Contractors. Copyright though most of the time is a default property of objects or images posted to the internet.
Going through an Individual contractor to attain a non-inherent copyright can provide better protections for your work. If your SVG is used by a large company, 
it will be trademarked. This is the more official "Copyrights" used by large companies to secure their creative intellectual properties.

#Information collection
COPPA protects children and the media they consume. (IE not exposing children to explici content) FERPA allows parents to access their childrens records (typically from
school systems) and HIPPA protects the privacy of the medical data that patiences have at any medical facility.

#Conclusion
After looking through all the articles and experimenting with SQL, I've found that perhaps databasing is a valid option for a career path for me. I personally thought
I would despise the concept of data management however in course of experimenting with it I have seen how well the organization systems can be creatively managed. 
In refreshing upon all the data protection laws, I have found myself ever greatful to this course in better educating me on how It and it's code can be used.
